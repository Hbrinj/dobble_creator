## Completed steps

- [x] Step 2 — Implement

## Resumption notes

### Branch state
- Currently on `feature/prettify-ui`, branched from `main` after PR #2 (`uploads-grid-with-remove`) was merged.
- HEAD = `ddde169`; 14 commits since `main`.
- Planning artefacts committed as `eb4e547` (`Add planning artefacts for prettify-ui`) — includes `tasks/prettify-ui.md`, this checkpoint, `ARCHITECTURE.md` (first-time, written by the architecture agent), and the `TODO.md` appendix.
- Implementation commits: `cb60c42` Slice 1 → `81fb99e` Slice 2 → `5295d8d` Slice 3 → `144743c` Slice 4 → `b773a1f` Slice 5 → `c053053` Slice 6 → `91db868` Slice 7 → `0c874c6` Slice 8. Each slice = one commit per the TDD-per-slice contract in the plan.
- Post-slice cleanups: `e773a8b` (self-review fix: collapse UploadDropzone transition + prettier sweep on touched files), `23f5128` (ARCHITECTURE.md: mark Tailwind/font/page-shell sections as current).
- Reviewer-driven follow-up commits: `3d4f3ed` (present-tense wording in ARCHITECTURE.md `src/index.css` row), `94e93d2` (keep Download PDF reachable after all images removed — added regression test), `ddde169` (clear `renderedCards` when generate fails mid-loop — added regression test).
- 108/108 Vitest tests passing; `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npx tsc -p e2e/tsconfig.json --noEmit` all clean as of `ddde169`.

### Architecture pass — DONE
The `architecture` agent ran on 2026-05-14 against `tasks/prettify-ui.md` and produced a first-time `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the stack (Tailwind v4, dark theme, sticky-chrome page shell, `@fontsource-variable/plus-jakarta-sans`, BEM removed). Verdict was ARCHITECTURE IMPACTED — handled by creating the doc; no source code touched in that pass.

### Review gate — IN PROGRESS

**Round 1 (against `23f5128`)**
- `code-reviewer` returned REQUEST CHANGES with 2 MAJOR findings (Download-PDF regression when all uploads removed after generate; revoked-preview-URL leak on `handleGenerate` throw) + 4 MINOR + 4 SUGGESTION.
- `general-reviewer` returned REQUEST CHANGES with 2 MAJOR findings (this checkpoint was stale; `ARCHITECTURE.md:28` had a leftover "Post-`prettify-ui`" tense marker) + 3 MINOR + 3 SUGGESTION.

**Round 1 fixes landed**
- `react-typescript-developer` was re-dispatched and applied both code MAJORs (`94e93d2`, `ddde169`) plus the ARCHITECTURE.md marker flip (`3d4f3ed`), each with a Vitest regression test where applicable.
- The coordinator refreshed this checkpoint to address `general-reviewer` MAJOR #1 (stale checkpoint).

**Round 2 (against `ddde169` + the refreshed checkpoint)**
- `code-reviewer` returned APPROVE — 0 Critical / 0 Major. Two MINOR items (notice-on-throw via `handleError`; redundant `hasImages` / `hasRenderedCards` locals used inconsistently) and four SUGGESTION items (URL bookkeeping symmetry, hiding Generate when `order == null && hasRenderedCards`, try/catch nesting style, `getByRole('banner')` over `header` locator in e2e) are deferred for the coordinator review gate.
- `general-reviewer` Round 2 is pending after this refresh.

**MINOR / SUGGESTION findings consolidated and deferred**
- Code MINOR: surface generate failures via `handleError` notice so the user sees what failed (not just an empty gallery and stopped spinner); normalise `hasImages` / `hasRenderedCards` locals vs inline `renderedCards.length > 0` use.
- Code SUGGESTION: clear `previewUrlsRef.current` after the catch path; hide Generate when `order == null && hasRenderedCards`; flatten the inner try/catch in `handleGenerate`; switch e2e `<header>` locator to `getByRole('banner')`.
- General MINOR: tighten the `thumbnail-grid` regex in the "no legacy BEM" test; redundant `aria-live="polite"` on `role="status"` `<ul>`; `text-slate-300 text-sm` on `<input type="file">` doesn't reach the OS button.
- General SUGGESTION: hoist shared input/button class strings; consider `@theme { --default-font-family }`; add `scroll-mt-20` / `pb-20` so preview rows aren't pinched by sticky bars; cosmetic backtick consistency in ARCHITECTURE.md.

These all become candidates for a follow-up polish slice or for `/TODO.md` if accepted as out-of-scope.

### Slice overview (full detail in `tasks/prettify-ui.md`; each slice = one commit with failing test → minimum impl, per coordinator workflow)
1. Foundation — Tailwind v4 + Plus Jakarta Sans + design tokens + page shell + sticky bars + primary buttons
2. UploadDropzone — dashed-border + cloud icon + drag-over scale
3. ThumbnailGrid — Tailwind migration, delete `ThumbnailGrid.css`, dark-theme badge re-skin
4. DeckSettings — card wrapper + "Deck Options" h2 + form-control restyling
5. PrintSettings — card wrapper + "Print Options" h2 + form-control restyling
6. Notices — banner-style alerts with `AlertTriangle` + warning colours + fade-in
7. Preview gallery — card wrapper + "Preview" h2 + larger output grid
8. Generate-button loading state — `Loader2` spinner + disabled

### Deferred items (consolidated to `/TODO.md` under `## From feature/prettify-ui`)
- Mobile-responsive polish (Decision 9 — desktop only)
- Light-mode / theme toggle (Decision 7 — dark only)
- Header furniture: icon, subtitle, repo link, version pill (Decision 15 — title only)
- `severity` field on notice type (Decision 16 — all-warnings this pass)
- Hide+style the card-back `<input type="file">` (Decision 11 — natives only)
- Empty-state copy when zero thumbnails uploaded
- Sticky bottom-bar internal layout fine-tuning (Decision 8 — developer-agent leaf call)

### Open questions
None.

### When resuming
PR #3 is open and awaiting review/merge. The only repo workflow (`deploy.yml`) runs on `push: main`, not on PRs, so there are no PR checks to monitor — deploy fires automatically after merge to `main`. Next coordinator action is to update this checkpoint and the `features/all_features.md` row once the PR merges (status → `Merged`, fill in merge date).
